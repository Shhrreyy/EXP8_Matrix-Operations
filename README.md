# ðŸ§® Matrix Operations in C++

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To implement basic matrix operations in C++ including addition, multiplication, transpose, diagonal addition, and row comparison using arrays and loops.

## ðŸ“š Theory

A **matrix** is a 2D array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.  
Matrix operations are widely used in mathematics, computer graphics, machine learning, and scientific computations.  

Key concepts:
- **Addition**: Performed by adding corresponding elements of two matrices of the same dimension.
- **Multiplication**: Rows of the first matrix multiplied with columns of the second matrix.
- **Transpose**: Flipping a matrix over its diagonal, switching rows with columns.
- **Diagonal operations**: Focused only on elements lying on the main diagonal.
- **Row comparison**: Comparing elements of specific rows for equality or magnitude.

## ðŸ§® Algorithms / Steps

### 1. **Addition of Two Matrices (`Add_2no.cpp`)**
- Input dimensions and elements of both matrices.
- Loop through rows and columns.
- Add corresponding elements: `C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]`.
- Print result.

### 2. **Diagonal Addition (`Diagonal_Addition.cpp`)**
- Input a square matrix.
- Traverse where `i == j`.
- Sum diagonal elements.
- Print sum.

### 3. **Matrix Multiplication (`Multiplication.cpp`)**
- Input dimensions and elements of matrices A (mÃ—n) and B (nÃ—p).
- Initialize result matrix C (mÃ—p) with zeros.
- Use triple nested loops:
  - `C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]`.
- Print result.

### 4. **Matrix Transpose (`Transpose.cpp`)**
- Input matrix A (mÃ—n).
- For each element `A[i][j]`, assign to `B[j][i]`.
- Print transpose matrix B.

### 5. **First & Second Row Comparison (`first_sec_row_comp.cpp`)**
- Input matrix.
- Extract elements of row1 and row2.
- Compare element-wise:
  - Print whether equal, greater, or smaller.
- Conclude relationship.
