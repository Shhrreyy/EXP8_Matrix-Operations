ðŸ“˜ Matrix and Number Operations in C++
ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To implement various arithmetic and matrix operations using C++. The programs demonstrate basic concepts such as addition of two numbers, diagonal sum of a matrix, matrix multiplication, matrix transpose, and row comparison in matrices.

ðŸ“š Theory

Matrices and numbers are foundational elements in programming and mathematics:

A number is a single data element used for arithmetic operations.

A matrix is a 2D array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.

Operations on matrices include addition, multiplication, transpose, and element-wise comparison.

These programs reinforce the use of loops, conditionals, arrays, and user input/output in C++.

ðŸ§® Algorithms / Steps

Add Two Numbers (Add_2no.cpp)

Input two numbers

Calculate their sum

Output the result

Diagonal Addition (Diagonal_Addition.cpp)

Input size n and n x n matrix elements

Initialize sum = 0

Loop through matrix elements and add those where row index = column index

Output the sum of diagonal elements

Matrix Multiplication (Multiplication.cpp)

Input dimensions and elements of matrices A and B

Check if multiplication is valid (cols of A == rows of B)

Multiply using nested loops and store in result matrix

Display the result matrix

Transpose of Matrix (Transpose.cpp)

Input matrix dimensions and elements

Create a new matrix by swapping rows and columns

Assign transpose[i][j] = original[j][i]

Output the transposed matrix

Compare First and Second Rows (first_sec_row_comp.cpp)

Input matrix dimensions and elements

Compare corresponding elements of the first and second rows

Display the comparison results

âœ… Conclusion

This set of programs provides practical experience with fundamental arithmetic and matrix operations in C++. These exercises build core skills in handling arrays, loops, and conditional logic, forming a base for more complex data processing and algorithmic problem solving.
